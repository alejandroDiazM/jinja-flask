# JINJA TEMPLATES

Test project to play around with Jinja and the use of templates and macros fro HTML rendering and logic.

To use and test this project, you'll need to install Jinja2 and Flask. I'd recommend doing so in a Pyhton virtual environment, like venv.

The commands you must follow to get started are:

```
python -m venv <name of your virtual environment>

...

pip install jinja2

...

pip install flask
```

After that, just run app.py (it will start a developer server at port 5000) and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to start testing.
